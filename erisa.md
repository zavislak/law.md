# Employee Retirement Income Security Program

The Employee Retirement Income Security Program, despite its name, covers more than just retirement.

Key points for employees:

- ERISA covers retirement plans (e.g., 401(k)) and certain other benefit programs (such as medical).
- Plan administrators have a duty to provide certain documents, including a summary plan description.  The most important documents must be specifically requested by the participant or beneficiary.
- Plans must have a reasonable claims procedure and an appeal procedure that affords a "full and fair review".
- Group health plans are prohibited from forcing participants to arbitrate their group health plan benefits in lieu of going to court.
- Attorneys fees are available to successful claimants who win after going to court to get their benefits.
- Courts may give [[deference]] to the original administrative decision if specified by the plan and the claims/appeals were decided fairly and reasonably; otherwise, the court will decide the issue [[de novo]].
