# Tort Law

In some instances, the [[law]] provides for a recovery for injuries suffered to person or to property.
The most readily available example is negligence, which is why many people purchase [[liability insurance]], such as car insurance, homeowners insurance, or renters insurance.
The intentional counterparts exist as well (e.g., [[battery law]]), 

There are a number of others too, a few examples:

- [[Defamation]]
- [[IP infringement]]
- [[Business interference]]

Most often damages are limited to [[compensatory damages]] only, but some torts (usually the intentional ones) have [[punitive damages]] available as well.
