# Business Interference

A part of [[tort law]].

One might incur liability by wrongfully interfering with another's business.
For example, inducing someone to break a contract, or interfering with a prospective business relationship could qualify as interference.
But to be actionable, the interference must also be _wrongful_ for a legal reason _other than the interference itself_.
