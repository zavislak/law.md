# Regulatory Law

If it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving, regulate it. And if it stops moving, subsidize it.

Regulatory law encompasses the enormous and continuously growing body of law that regulates human and device behavior.
Unlike [[tort law]] which requires either proof of damages or proof of intent to cause harm in order to be actionable, regulatory law only requires proof of noncompliance.

Regulatory law:

- Requires you to take or prohibits you from taking certain medical treatments.
- Establishes minimum workplace safety conditions.
- Sets the rules of the road.
- Prohibits engaging in many professions without a license, and otherwise controls their practice.
- Controls the use of the electromagnetic spectrum.
- Sets the content and format of nutrition labels.
- Protects employee retirement funds.  [[ERISA]]
