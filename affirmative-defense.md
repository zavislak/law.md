# Affirmative Defense

There are two ways to avoid a legal claim: attack the plaintiff's case, or make your own case why you should not have liability.  The latter is known as raising an affirmative defense.

Affirmative defenses include:

- [[laches]]
- [[self defense]]
- [[statute of limitations]]
