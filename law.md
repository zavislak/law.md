# Law

The law consists of all the rules enforceable by a governmental authority.
These are commonly divided into [[civil law]] and [[criminal law]].
Whereas the civil law is only enforceable against property, criminal law may also be enforced against the person (both arrest and imprisonment).

At times the lines between the two are blured.
For example, certain criminal law violations will never lead to either arrest nor imprisonment.
And the remedy for certain civil law violations may be an injunction, which can mandate or prohibit certain behavior.
The violation of such an injunction may include criminal penalties or criminal-like penalties (such as imprisonment).

@law primarily covers U.S. law, but tries to generalize where possible.
