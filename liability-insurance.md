# Liability Insurance

A defense against [[tort law]], and the easiest way to have lawyers oncall to defend you.

Liability insurance is a [[contract]] issued by a an insurance company in exchange for a premium, whereby the insurer agrees to defend the insured against potential legal liability for damages allegedly caused by the insured's conduct (usually called a "claim").

As long as the insurance company agrees the claim is covered, the insured's interests and the insurance company's interests are aligned all the way up to the policy limit.

This is in contrast with other types of insurance where the insurance company agrees to compensate the insured for your insured's own losses.
In those types of insurance policies, the insurer and the insured are at odds with each other.
