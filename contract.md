# Contract

The formalization of a mutually beneficial relationship among or between two or more parties.

Issues to look out for:

- Was there mutual assent?
- Was there a mutual exchange of [[consideration]]?  A completely one sided agreement is generally unenforceable, but there are exceptions (e.g., [[promissory estoppel]], or a [[promissory note]]).
- Was there an [[integration clause]] contained within a written agreement?  If not, other evidence outside of the written agreement may be introduced if a dispute arises.
